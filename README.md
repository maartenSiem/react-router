# react-router
Basic router setup template for react.
This also removes weird looking links

###How it works?
If you have not installed npm please do that first.
From the command line run: 
`npm install`
To run the program: 
`npm start`

###Server
In order for this to work you will need to set up a local server.
Many IDE's do this for you.
If you want a very basic server you can download
